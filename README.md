# Data analysis - Why do students drop out?

When starting an engineering degree, one of the biggest challenges for students is the subjects of calculus and algebra. Currently, an average of 50% of students are unable to complete these subjects in the Mechanical Engineering course at the Federal University of Tri√¢ngulo Mineiro.

The difficulties during the course are not different from what the students encountered in the past, but each day the number of students thinking about giving up the course from the 1st to the 4th year increases. 

This work seeks to calculate statistical data to understand, in addition to the difficulties in mathematics subjects which are historically a challenge, why are students currently giving up on graduation?

This Python code applies pandas, matplotlib, seaborn and numpy in the statistical computations and to make some graphs.

A post in the Medium named: BEYOND THE ALGEBRA: WHAT IS GOING ON WITH OUR ENGINEERING STUDENTS? present the main results and analysis done.
